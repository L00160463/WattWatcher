# WattWatcher

## Introduction
WattWatcher is an innovative IoT-based system designed to monitor residential energy consumption in real-time. This project is part of My final thesis for the BSc (Hons) in Applied Computing at Atlantic Technological University.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Provides instant updates on electricity usage.
- **Cross-Platform Accessibility**: Manage and view data via a .NET MAUI application.
- **Cloud Integration**: Data is securely stored and managed using Firebase.
- **Alerts System**: Notifications for critical usage levels and changes in tariff rates.

## System Architecture
- **Hardware**: Utilizes the ESP-32 module and Current Transformer (CT) Clamps.
- **Software**: Firebase for backend storage; .NET MAUI for the frontend application.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Arduino IDE
- .NET MAUI SDK
- Firebase account

### Installation Guide
1. **Clone the Repository**
git clone https://github.com/L00160463/WattWatcher.git

2. **Configure the Arduino Environment**
- Install required libraries in Arduino IDE.
- Upload code to the ESP-32 module.
3. **Set up Firebase**
- Create and configure a new Firebase project.
- Integrate Firebase with the .NET MAUI application.
4. **Launch the .NET MAUI Application**
- Open and run the solution in Visual Studio.

## How to Use
Operate the system to begin monitoring electricity usage. The application displays real-time and historical data insights.
